  Essentials
  ------------------------------

  Pollex is an tool to support online communities to reach consensus

  on opinions, preferences and joint decisions.

  You may want to use Pollex to carrying out online polls to

  chose an option from among a finite set of predefined alternatives or to

  inform their availability for scheduling an event in a range or dates.

  Beyond the capabilities of some alternative tools, Pollex allows  flexible

  customization of pools rules and decision criteria such as

     * making a single choice between mutually exclusive alternatives;
  
     * choosing one or more options between a set of possible choices;

     * expressing relative preferences between a list of options;

  Also, the poll policy and decision criteria may be chosen from different

  available formats to meet the team needs. For instance it may 

     * allow or not partial results to be known during the poll;

     * allow or not participants to change votes before the poll ends;

     * votes to be either secret or publicly visible by other participants

     * poll to end either after a deadline or when a majority is reached.
